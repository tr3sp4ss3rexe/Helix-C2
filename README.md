# Helix C2
This project has been done for a university course called "The individual project course". According to the requirements list I revceived for this project, this is supposed to be a C2 server which suites the needs of blue teamers and network admins controlling their remote devices and gathering a specific set of info, therefore the only available payload option for now is a GUI client for Windows OS. In the future updates I will be adding payloads/agents suitable for offensive security operations and eventually other platforms.
